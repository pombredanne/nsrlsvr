nsrlsvr
=======
nsrlsvr is a tool to facilitate looking up data in the National Software
Reference Library (NSRL).

Installation instructions are found in the INSTALL file.  Please read them.
Due to the size of the NSRL's reference data set (RDS), installing nsrlsvr
is a little bit more involved than one would like.
