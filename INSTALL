Installation instructions:

0.  Please use official releases over the git master branch.  The
    git master branch isn't guaranteed to work properly.

1.  nsrlsvr requires a C++ compiler that can handle the latest C++
    specification (C++14).  GCC 4.8 claims to be a C++14 compiler,
    but it isn't, and won't be able to compile nsrlsvr.

2.  Download the latest minimal RDS from http://www.nsrl.nist.gov.
    This file will likely be named "rds_XYZm.zip", where XYZ is the
    version number and the 'm' stands for 'minimal'.

3.  Uncompress it and keep track of where your NSRLFile.txt is.
    (Note: As of Yosemite, OS X lacks support for large ZIP files.
	This is beyond my control.  Ask Apple for technical support,
	not me!)

4.  Make sure you have cmake installed.  cd into the toplevel of the
    build directory and run cmake.  ("cmake ." will usually suffice.)

5.  Do the make && sudo make install dance.  The following two
    applications will be installed:

    * nsrlsvr, which serves hashes
    * nsrlupdate, which wipes the DB and loads a new RDS

    However, no hash list has been installed.  You must do this
    (as explained in the next step) before using nsrlsvr.

6.  To create the data file, use nsrlupdate.  E.g., if your RDS is
    stored at /home/rjh/RDS_247m/NSRLFile.txt:

    $ sudo nsrlupdate /home/rjh/RDS_247m/NSRLFile.txt

    Warning: *this might take a long time*.  As of RDS 2.47m, there
    are over 40 million hashes there constituting a hashes.txt file
    of 1,333,423,179 bytes (!!).  That takes a few minutes to extract
    and write to disk.  You'll have time for a cup of coffee.

7.  You can now start nsrlsvr!

    $ nsrlsvr

8.  If you want to add more hashes, make sure your list of hashes

    * contains one MD5 hash per line
    * is represented as 32 hexadecimal uppercase digits
    * has nothing else in it
    * does not duplicate any existing hash value

    Then just append it to $PREFIX/share/nsrlsvr/hashes.txt.
