nsrlsvr helps forensicists with data triage by making it easy to query
NIST's database of known MD5 hashes.  Once loaded with a set of hashes,
forensicists can use tools like nsrllookup to check for presence or
absence in the dataset.  nsrlsvr stores everything in an efficient RAM
structure for speed, and is capable of supporting extremely high
query volumes.
